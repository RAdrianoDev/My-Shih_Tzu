                    <h3>Where is Shih Tzu from?!</h3>
                    <p>People commonly associate the Shih Tzu with China, but they actually came from China's western neighbor,
                        Tibet, which was a sovereign nation until the 1950s. Tibet probably sent dogs to the Chinese royalty as
                        gifts. The Chinese then bred them with Pekingese or Pugs to create the modern-day Shih

                    <h3>Are Shih Tzus smart?</h3>
                    <p>Shih Tzus are typically considered to be smart dogs and have even been to assist farmers and tradesmen in
                        the past. However, Shih Tzus can also be stubborn at times. Shih Tzu's intelligence varies from
                        individual
                        to individual, but most people agree they are pretty good problem solvers.<br><sub>font: <a

                    <h3>Royalty?</h3>
                    <p>One interesting fact about Shih Tzu dogs is that they were highly valued by Chinese royalty. Shih Tzus have a long history dating back over a thousand years, and they were bred and pampered by Chinese emperors and empresses. These dogs were often considered sacred and were even given as gifts to other royal families. The name "Shih Tzu" translates to "lion dog" in Mandarin, which reflects their regal and lion-like appearance. Today, Shih Tzus are beloved companion dogs known for their friendly and affectionate nature.</p>
